# React Engine

## Powered by Cody

Cody is a code monkey bot running in the context of a project. It's communicating with prooph board and translates a visual design in working code at realtime.
Cody IMS is a preconfigured skeleton app based on React and Material UI with integrated Cody frontend hooks.

## Installation
Please make sure you have installed [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/ "Install Docker")
and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ "Install Docker Compose").

```bash
cp .env.dist .env
cp app.env.dist app.env
docker-compose run --rm cody yarn install
docker-compose run --rm ee-app yarn install
```

## Running

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
## Repo Structure

It's split into two main parts:

1.) The React + Material UI App found in `/app/src`
2.) Cody server `/cody/src` & IMS specific Cody hooks in `/cody/hooks`

### Install Dependencies

You have to install dependencies for both parts independently:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm cody yarn install
docker-compose run --rm ee-app yarn install
```
## Connect to Cody

Open a board in prooph board and connect Cody on `http://localhost:3322`
Cody will say hello.

## Open the app
[http://localhost:3323/ims](http://localhost:3323/ims)

## App Core

Most of the code in `/app` will be generated by Cody. But the system also comes with a stable core, that is not touched by
code generator and nor should it be touched by you! If you find a bug in the core or would like to see a new feature supported,
please add it to the skeleton upstream and merge back into the project app core. This way other projects can benefit from it as well.
